Historically, the landscape has long been shaped by naturally occurring fires and many plant and ecological communities of Southern Appalachia have evolved to depend on periodic wildfires to thrive. However, fires can also be a force of danger and destruction under certain conditions. Since the park was founded in 1934, several fire management policies have been adapted. Today fires are managed by controlled burns in an effort to simulate the conservation benefits caused by natural wildfires while minimizing the potential danger and damage caused by inevitable unplanned fires. Although dangerous fires are rare, these events do occasionally occur.",

    "info": "The compass bearing a given slope is facing from 0-360. In geography, aspect describes the cardinal direction a particular slope is facing. If a slope is facing south, it has an aspect of 180°. A slope in the Northern Hemisphere with a southern aspect will receive more exposure to the sun than a slope facing north. The reverse is true for the Southern Hemisphere. Due to this directional relationship to the sunlight, the aspect of a slope can greatly influence factors such as temperature, humidity, and plant distribution. ",
